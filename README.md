Doric is a lightweight library for implementing and extending progressive neural networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671.pdf).
It is a free and open-source library built atop PyTorch.

Doric utilizes user-made blocks to design column networks, which are then generated for new tasks in the prognet.
We support inert blocks (blocks without laterals) and multi-channel blocks.

Thank you to Case Wright for help in developing Doric and writing all of our autoencoder tests.
Thank you to Molly Jacobson for the Doric logo.
