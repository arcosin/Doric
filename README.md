Doric is a lightweight library for implementing and extending progressive neural networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671.pdf).
It is a free and open-source library built atop PyTorch.

Doric utilizes user-made blocks to design column networks, which are then generated for new tasks in the prognet.
We support inert blocks (blocks without laterals) and multi-channel blocks.

Thank you to Case Wright for help in developing Doric and writing all of our autoencoder tests, and to Molly Jacobson for the Doric logo.


Changes:
- 1/15/2021 -- 1.1.0: ProgRes update! Skip connections added. Changes made to multichannel blocks. Several utilities added.
